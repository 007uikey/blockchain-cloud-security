# blockchain-cloud-security
Academic project to enhance data security in cloud using blockchain
This project is developed as part of my final year engineering curriculum to enhance the security and privacy of health records using blockchain and encryption technologies.

## 💡 Project Objective

To create a secure, decentralized system that enables role-based access to medical records stored in the cloud. The system ensures:
- Confidentiality using AES-256 encryption
- Transparency through smart contracts
- Controlled access via admin-assigned roles

## 🔐 Technologies Used

- **Solidity** – Smart contract development
- **Python (Flask)** – Backend services and AES encryption
- **HTML + JavaScript** – Frontend interface
- **MetaMask + Web3.js** – Blockchain wallet interaction
- **Hardhat** – Local Ethereum development environment
- **AWS S3** – Encrypted cloud file storage
- **MongoDB** – User and metadata storage

## 🧱 Project Modules

1. **Module 1 – Data Encryption & Cloud Storage**
   - AES-256 encryption for secure file upload
   - Encrypted files stored in AWS S3

2. **Module 2 – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Admin assigns roles (doctor, patient, lab tech) via smart contract
   - Role is verified before accessing records

3. **Module 3 – Integrity & Audit Trail (Planned)**
   - Track access and verify file integrity using hashes

4. **Module 4 – smart contract management and compliance**
   - contract registry for tracability of contract.
## 🧪 Features

- User registration & login
- Encrypted file upload
- Admin role assignment via MetaMask
- Access restrictions based on role
- Secure, transparent, tamper-proof logic
